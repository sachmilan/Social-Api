# Professional Readme

## Description

-  In today's era everything is based on technology, even interaction with another person is based on technology. By keeping that in mind I decided to create a Social Network app, where you can interact with your friends.

- To achieve my goal, I created this application. In this application you can make users, and friends. A user can post thoughts and reactions to the thoughts. 

- It will make the interactions with your friends fun.

-Java script and Jquery were totally new to me, so I learned them and used them in a way which enhances my understanding of them.
